      question: "What is entropy in the context of decision trees?",
      options: [
        "A measure of how fast the algorithm runs",
        "A measure of impurity or randomness in the data",
        "The number of features in the dataset",
        "The depth of the decision tree"
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: "Entropy quantifies the amount of disorder or impurity in a dataset.\n\nEntropy = 0 ‚Üí All data belongs to one class (pure).\n\nEntropy is highest when classes are evenly mixed."
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      question: "Which splitting criterion tries to maximize information gain?",
      options: [
        "Random splitting",
        "Alphabetical order",
        "Entropy-based splitting",
        "Size-based splitting"
      ],
      correct: 2,
      explanation: "Information gain measures the reduction in entropy after a split.\nEntropy-based splitting (like in ID3) chooses the attribute that gives the highest information gain, i.e., the greatest reduction in impurity."
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      question: "What happens when a decision tree node has entropy = 0?",
      options: [
        "The algorithm stops and creates a leaf node",
        "The tree continues growing indefinitely",
        "An error occurs",
        "The node is deleted"
      ],
      correct: 0,
      explanation: "When entropy is 0, it means all samples in the node are from the same class.\nTherefore, the algorithm stops splitting and converts this node into a leaf node that predicts that class."
    },
    {
      id: 4,
      question: "What is information gain?",
      options: [
        "The total number of questions asked",
        "The reduction in entropy after a split",
        "The accuracy of the model",
        "The time saved by using the algorithm"
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: "Information Gain = Entropy(before split) ‚Äì Weighted Entropy(after split).\nIt tells us how much uncertainty is reduced after making a decision (split)."
    },
    {
      id: 5,
      question: "Which parameter controls the maximum depth of a decision tree in scikit-learn?",
      options: [
        "min_samples_split",
        "criterion",
        "max_depth",
        "random_state"
      ],
      correct: 2,
      explanation: "In scikit-learn‚Äôs DecisionTreeClassifier, the max_depth parameter limits how deep the tree can grow.\nThis helps control overfitting by restricting tree complexity."
    },
    {
      id: 6,
      question: "In the tennis playing example, why is 'Weather' often the best first split?",
      options: [
        "It's the first column in the dataset",
        "It has the highest information gain",
        "It has the most possible values",
        "It's the most important feature"
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: "In the classic ‚ÄúPlay Tennis‚Äù dataset, 'Weather' usually results in pure subsets when split, especially 'Overcast', which always leads to 'Play'.\nHence, it provides the most information gain at the root."
    },
    {
      id: 7,
      question: "What type of features can the basic ID3 algorithm handle?",
      options: [
        "Categorical features only",
        "Numerical features only",
        "Both categorical and numerical features",
        "Text and image features"
      ],
      correct: 0,
      explanation: "The original ID3 algorithm cannot directly handle continuous (numerical) features.\nThey need to be converted into categories (discretized) before being used."
    },
    {
      id: 8,
      question: "What is a major disadvantage of the ID3 algorithm?",
      options: [
        "It is very slow to train",
        "It is biased towards features with more values",
        "It cannot handle more than 10 features",
        "It only works for binary classification"
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: "ID3 favors attributes with many unique values (like ID numbers), because they seem to split the data well, even though it might be misleading.\nThis is called attribute-value bias."
    },
    {
      id: 9,
      question: "How does the ID3 algorithm handle missing values?",
      options: [
        "It automatically replaces them with the mean",
        "It treats 'missing' as a separate category",
        "The original algorithm does not have a standard method",
        "It deletes the entire row of data"
      ],
      correct: 2,
      explanation: "ID3 doesn‚Äôt define how to handle missing values.\nModern adaptations use strategies like imputation, probabilistic splits, or treating missing as a separate category, but these are not part of original ID3."
    },
    {
      id: 10,
      question: "Which of the following algorithms is a successor to ID3 that addresses some of its limitations?",
      options: [
        "K-Nearest Neighbors",
        "Linear Regression",
        "C4.5",
        "Support Vector Machines"
      ],
      correct: 2,
      explanation: "C4.5 was developed by Ross Quinlan to improve ID3.\nIt supports continuous attributes, handles missing values, and uses gain ratio instead of information gain to reduce bias toward multi-valued attributes."
